Created a predictive model (random forest) for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to predict the results of individual matches using team and player attributes; Trained the model on the results of qualification matches as well as previous international tournament fixtures since 1998; Successfully predicted the result of 54 out of 64 matches at the World Cup
Followed a modified approach and used batsmen-bowler interaction & individual player performances in the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament to generate ball-by-ball predictions; Successfully predicted 80% of the matches
