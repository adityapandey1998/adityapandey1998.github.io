Hey there!
I am Aditya. I am a Master's Student at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences currently studying Computer Science.
<br>
<br>
I am currently a Graduate Teaching Assistant at NYU, handling the Cloud and ML course under Prof. Chung and the Algorithms course under Prof. Cole. This past summer, I was an intern at LiveRamp working on projects related to Big Data and Distributed Systems. Previously, I have worked at Walmart as a Software Engineer in the Data & Analytics field and been a TA for various other courses at NYU. I have also interned at PwC and Walmart where I gained diverse experiences in Data Analytics and Backend Development.
<br>
<br>
My main areas of interest lie in Distributed Systems, Machine Learning and everything Data related. In the past, I have worked as a Research Assistant under Dr. Snehanshu Saha (currently at BITS Goa) in theoretical Machine Learning and am currently specializing in Big Data Distrbuted Systems at NYU.
<br>
<br>
I graduated with a Bachelor's in Technology from PES Univerity in 2020 and was awarded the CNR Rao Merit Scholarship for my performances there.
<br>

In terms of hobbies, I am a big sports fan - especially Football (Soccer) and Cricket. I enjoy analyzing matches and love reading about the application of big data analytics in Sports. I also enjoy traveling to different places, playing FIFA and watching movies in the psycho-thriller genre.
